# ShoppingApi

ShoppingApi is a java based library that allows new and old android developer to create a shopping android application with ease without having to write or create a pojo class.
<p>It helps you to check for an input in <b>ArrayList</b>,if user has added or removed a cart and it returns the object for you to process.</p>

# <p>The example below shows how to use the apiðŸ‘‡</p>

<p>
  <p>Firstly create a class to extend ShopUser.class,
note this represent your user account, you can always define your own construct.
  </p>
 But here we are using the default construct.

  public class MyShopUser extends ShopUser{
     public MyShopUser(String user_id){
          super(user_id);
        }
  }
